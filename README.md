# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Python
Project Overview
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model for predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. The model utilizes various passenger attributes such as age, sex, class, and ticket fare to classify passengers as either survivors or fatalities.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available. It contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their survival status, age, sex, class, and other relevant features.

Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn Â  

Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset file (e.g., titanic.csv).
src: Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models: Stores trained models.
